This directory contains the next generation of EDK II build tools and template files.
Templates are located in the Conf directory, while the tools executables for
Microsoft Windows 32-bit Operating Systems are located in the Bin\Win32 directory.

The binary tools will be updated only after passing developer testing.

The BaseTools package will be updated with new tools only after all testing on a set
of binary tools has successfully completed.

Current state of the tools is Proto-Type - not all tool functions have been implemented
and there may be bugs in these tools.  These tools are under constant development at
this time.

BaseTools Simple Usage:
1) Change the directory to the EDK2 root directory, where the edksetup.bat is
2) Run "edksetup.bat NewBuild"
3) Set the ACTIVE_PLATFORM to your desired platform description file 
   (%WORKSPACE%\Conf\target.txt)
4) To build platform, run "build" command in non-module directory
5) To build module individually, run "build" command in module directory, i.e. where the 
   *.inf file is

Notes:
1) Only *.efi files can be generated. Flash image cannot be generated at present.
2) Only "clean" and "cleanall" build target are supported, in both top level 
   makefile and module's makefile. 
3) Not all tool chains and target architectures are tested. Due to both tools 
   and source code limitations, ther must be bugs in it. Please report any issue 
	 ASAP so we can fix it soon.
4) The tree structure generated by build tools is similar to Ant build system.
5) Makefile can be called directly by nmake for both top level platform and module. But
   after you call "nmake cleanall", you have to call "build" command to rebuild platform
	 or modules because the AutoGen.* files have been be removed. The "makefile" itself
	 cannot generate AutoGen.* files. Only "build" command can.
