This directory contains the next generation of EDK II build tools and template files.
Templates are located in the Conf directory, while the tools executables for
Microsoft Windows 32-bit Operating Systems are located in the Bin\Win32 directory.

The binary tools will be updated only after passing developer testing.

The BaseTools package will be updated with new tools only after all testing on a set
of binary tools has successfully completed.

Current state of the tools is Proto-Type - not all tool functions have been implemented
and there may be bugs in these tools.  These tools are under constant development at
this time.
