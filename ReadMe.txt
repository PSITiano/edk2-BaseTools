This directory contains the next generation of EDK II build tools and template files.
Templates are located in the Conf directory, while the tools executables for
Microsoft Windows 32-bit Operating Systems are located in the Bin\Win32 directory.

The binary tools will be updated only after passing developer testing.

The BaseTools package will be updated with new tools only after all testing on a set
of binary tools has successfully completed.

Current state of the tools is Proto-Type - not all tool functions have been implemented
and there may be bugs in these tools.  These tools are under constant development at
this time.

BaseTools Simple Usage:
1) Change the directory to the EDK2 root directory, where the edksetup.bat is
2) Run "edksetup.bat NewBuild"
3) Set the ACTIVE_PLATFORM to your desired platform description file 
   (%WORKSPACE%\Conf\target.txt)
4) To build platform, run "build" command in non-module directory
5) To build module individually, run "build" command in module directory, i.e. where the 
   *.inf file is

Notes:
1) The tree structure generated by build tools is similar to Ant build system.
2) Makefile can be called directly by nmake for both top level platform and module. But
   after you call "nmake cleanall", you have to call "build" command to rebuild platform
	 or modules because the AutoGen.* files have been be removed. The "makefile" itself
	 cannot generate AutoGen.* files. Only "build" command can.
3) build.exe in %WORKSPACE%\BaseTools\Bin\Win32 is generated from following revision of
   Python source code:
        r601 <buildtools_project>\BaseTools\Source\Python\Autogen
        r601 <buildtools_project>\BaseTools\Source\Python\Python\build
        r569 <buildtools_project>\BaseTools\Source\Python\Python\Common
        r564 <buildtools_project>\BaseTools\Source\Python\Python\CommonDataClass

Brief usage for Migration Tool MigrationMsa2Inf.exe:
1. Command line format:
  MigrationMsa2Inf [options]
2. Input Files:
  A syntactically valid MSA file
3. Output Files:
  An extended INF file with possible auto-generated EntryPoint.c, CommonHeader.h/CommonHeader.txt, depending on options and module contents.
4. Prerequisite:
   a. The workspace directory must be specified either by environment variable or -w option.  
   b. The Framework Database file must exist to specify the available packages in current workspace. 
      Two possible locations are: (The first location overrides the second)
            $(WORKSPACE)\Tools\Conf\FrameworkDatabase.db
            $(WORKSPACE)\Conf\FrameworkDatabase.db.  
      The <PackageList> field in FrameworkDatabase.db lists all available packages in current workspace. 
      One example:
      <PackageList>
        <Filename>MdePkg/MdePkg.nspd</Filename>
        <Filename>MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.spd</Filename>
        <Filename>IntelFrameworkPkg/IntelFrameworkPkg.spd</Filename>
      </PackageList>
      The package list in FrameworkDatabase.db is important to the final quality of migration:
      (1) It suggests the new package location: Translate package dependency Guid in MSA to Workspace relative path. 
         If the package dependency Guid cannot be found in current workspace a warning message is raised. 
      (2) It collects the Protocol/Guid/Ppi GuidCName a package contains. 
         The GuidCName acts as "clue" to add e.g. #include <Protocol/DiskIo.h> in CommonHeader.h
     
5. Example:
   WORKSAPCE has already been set: $(WORKSPACE) = c:\work\EdkII. 
 
   a. MigrationMsa2Inf -f c:\work\EdkII\Nt32Pkg\WinNtThunkDxe\WinNtThunk.msa -o c:\work\EdkII\Nt32Pkg\WinNtThunkDxe\WinNtThunk.inf
   b. MigrationMsa2Inf -f c:\work\EdkII\Nt32Pkg\WinNtThunkDxe\WinNtThunk.msa -a
   Example a & b are equivalent to migrate WinNtThunk driver from EDKII to EDKII' code base.
  
   c. MigrationMsa2Inf -f c:\work\EdkII\Nt32Pkg\WinNtThunkDxe\WinNtThunk.msa -a -c
   The extra "-c" option performs several hardcode mapping due to the naming change in EDKII': 
      OldMdePkg Guid -> MdePkgGuid, 
      EdkModulePkg Guid -> MdeModulePkgGuid, 
      EdkGraphicsLib -> GraphicsLib
      HiiLib -> HiiLibFramework
      ...
   
   d. MigrationMsa2Inf -f c:\work\EdkII\Nt32Pkg\WinNtThunkDxe\WinNtThunk.msa -m
   The extra "-m" option suppresses the generation of "CommonHeader.h" and leave all C files intact. 
   Instead, it generates "CommonHeader.txt". Developers can manually copy its content to a local common header file in a module. 
 
6. Known Limitations:
   a. Tool does not handle Exit Boot Services Callback & Virtual Address Changed Event. Developers need  to handle it manually.
   b. The #include <Library/AbcLib.h> is based on library class naming convention: The header filename for "AbcLib" class are "AbcLib.h" by convention.
   c. The #include <Guid/Xyz.h>, <Protocol/Xyz.h> and <Ppi/Xyz.h> are added based on gGuidCName listed in MSA. 
      If a GuidCName cannot map to a package Guid/Protocol/Ppi header file, a warning message is raised.
      If a module uses the definition in a pakcage Guid/Protocol/Ppi header file without list its associative GuidCName, the build will beak. Developer needs to       manually add the include statement.
   d. The [Depex] sections are generated from DXS files with Guid Macro translated to Guid CName by naming convention, etc.
    If tool fails to "guess" the Guid CName from Guid Macro, it will leave the GuidMacro in [Depex] section for manual resolution.
   e. When tool generates [Sources] section, the modifiers for source files are lost. (Need to add proper tool chain, etc)
   f. When tool generates [LibraryClasses] section, the recommended library instances are lost. (No impact to build)
